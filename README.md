# Project PROJECT_NAME

[Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet)

### Student Info

-   Name: Thomas Berrios
-   Section: 03

## Game Design

-   Camera Orientation: The game will be viewed from the side.
-   Camera Movement: As of currently, the camera is fixed with the player moving around the screen. It will likely stay like this, but screen wrapping will probably be removed.
-   Player Health: The player will have 3 lives, with each hit taken removing a life. (Lives amount subject to change.)
-   End Condition: Each level would likely end by either clearing all the enemies or defeating a stronger miniboss/boss at the end.
-   Scoring: Points would be gathered by killing enemies and/or clearing levels.

### Game Description

_A brief explanation of your game. Inculde what is the objective for the player. Think about what would go on the back of a game box._

    -   Down: S
    -   Left: A
    -   Right: D

## You Additions

During this milestone, I added some animations to the player sprite to make it unique, but the main thing I want to add is an inclusion of a boss enemy to finish off each level (or the one depending on how many we do).
